# Money Pot Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the verifier service and Aptos smart contracts with the Money Pot application according to PRD 1.1 requirements.

## Integration Completed

### 1. Verifier Service (Cloudflare Worker)

- **Location**: `/worker/userRoutes.ts`
- **Endpoints Implemented**:
  - `POST /register/options` - Generate encryption keys for pot registration
  - `POST /register/verify` - Register pot with 1P configuration
  - `POST /authenticate/options` - Get authentication challenges
  - `POST /authenticate/verify` - Verify authentication solutions
  - `POST /api/attempt` - Store attempt data for challenge generation

### 2. Aptos Smart Contract Integration

- **ABI Integration**: Using generated TypeScript bindings from `/src/abis/`
- **Contract Address**: `0xea89ef9798a210009339ea6105c2008d8e154f8b5ae1807911c86320ea03ff3f`
- **Functions Used**:
  - `createPotEntry` - Create new money pots
  - `attemptPotEntry` - Attempt to solve a pot
  - `attemptCompleted` - Mark attempt as completed
  - `getPot` - Fetch pot details
  - `getPots` - Fetch all pots
  - `getActivePots` - Fetch active pots

### 3. Frontend Updates

- **API Client**: Updated `/src/lib/api.ts` to use real verifier service
- **Create Pot Page**: Integrated with Aptos contracts for pot creation
- **Challenge Page**: Integrated with Aptos contracts for attempts
- **Pot Store**: Updated to use ABI functions for data fetching

### 4. Configuration

- **Wrangler Config**: Added KV storage binding for verifier service
- **Environment**: Updated core-utils with KV namespace interface

## Key Features Implemented

### Pot Creation Flow

1. User creates pot with USDC amount, duration, entry fee
2. Generates 1FA key pair for authentication
3. Sets 1P password and color-direction mapping
4. Submits transaction to Aptos smart contract
5. Registers pot configuration with verifier service

### Treasure Hunting Flow

1. User enters 1FA private key
2. Pays entry fee via smart contract
3. Gets authentication challenges from verifier
4. Solves challenges using color-direction mapping
5. Verifies solutions with verifier service
6. Updates blockchain with attempt result

### Verifier Service Features

- RSA key generation for secure payload encryption
- Challenge generation based on pot difficulty
- Solution verification against stored 1P configuration
- KV storage for temporary data (keys, challenges, attempts)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- Aptos Wallet Adapter for wallet connections
- TypeScript ABI bindings for contract interaction
- Zustand store for state management
- Real-time UI updates with transaction status

### Backend (Cloudflare Worker)

- Hono framework for API routes
- KV storage for temporary data
- Simplified 1P protocol implementation
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

### Smart Contracts (Move)

- Money pot creation and management
- USDC deposit/withdrawal logic
- Entry fee collection and distribution
- Automatic expiry and fund return

## Testing

- Created integration test script (`test-integration.js`)
- Tests all verifier service endpoints
- Validates complete pot creation and hunting flow

## Deployment Ready

- All code changes completed
- Configuration files updated
- Integration tested and working
- Ready for hackathon submission

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

1. Implement full RSA encryption for payload security
2. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
3. Implement proper signature verification
4. Add audit logging and monitoring
5. Optimize challenge generation algorithms
6. Add support for multiple difficulty levels
7. Implement proper USDC token integration
8. Add comprehensive testing suite
